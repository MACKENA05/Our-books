When I was a graduate student at Kansas State my stories tended to run sideways: a series of scenes upon scenes with turns and twists and lots of reveals, but something about the whole process felt like I was in search of a structure, or hoping everything would just work out. I knew stories were about change and I just kept adding scene upon scene hoping somewhere along the way the change would just happen. There was a random episodic quality to my stories and all of them ran 30 or so pages. As a writer I was just trying to survive the story, inventing more and more stuff to keep going.
